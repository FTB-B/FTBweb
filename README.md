## Projects
### Driver Identification using smarphones sensors (The project was partially funded by NSF <img src="./assets/img/nsf.jpeg" width="50" />)[Publication 1](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3241539.3267769), [Publication 2](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9209713)

- Developed a low cost system to identify drivers on a single turning event with above 90% accuracy.
- Considered different driving/turning scenarios such as turn on intesection with/without stop signs.
- Extracted feaures from different smart phone sensors including Gyroscope, Accelerometer are used to reflect unique drivers.
- Developed a multi-stage GBT classifer to increase the accuracy.
- Technologies:Android, SQLite, Apache, MATLAB, Signal processing, Statistics, Feature extraction, GBT.
  
### Studied the use of Fauxtography and spread of misinformation on social media. [Publication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.11792.pdf)

- The first large-scale study of fauxtography, analyzed the use of manipulated or misleading images in news discussion on online communities.
- Showed that fauxtography images are often turned into memes by Web communities.
- Technologies: Python, hypothesis testing, image classification.

### Studied sinophobic behaviors on social media during COVID-19 outbreak. [Publication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.11792.pdf](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200404046T/abstract)https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200404046T/abstract)
