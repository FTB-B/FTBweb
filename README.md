## Projects
### Driver Identification using smarphones sensors (The project was partially funded by NSF /assets/img/nsf.jpeg)
[Publication 1](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3241539.3267769)
[Publication 2](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9209713)

- Developed a low cost system to identify drivers on a single turning event with above 90% accuracy.
- Considered different driving/turning scenarios such as turn on intesection with/without stop signs.
- Extracted feaures from different smart phone sensors including Gyroscope, Accelerometer are used to reflect unique drivers.
- Developed a multi-stage GBT classifer to increase the accuracy.
- Technologies:Android, SQLite, Apache, MATLAB, Signal processing, Statistics, Feature extraction, GBT.
